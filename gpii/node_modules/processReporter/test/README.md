C#/.NET Unit Testing
===

GPII has typically used `node-ffi` for accessing Windows OS functionality.  But, another route is available via `edge.js`.  Using `edge.js` allows one to implement some functionality using C#/.NET, while wrapping that implementation inside a `node.js` (JavaScript) function.  The purpose of edge.js/C#/.NET is to get at Windows native OS specific features that are not directly available from `node`, and to allow calling on them from node/JavaScript.  By comparison, in the case of Linux, we use C++ to build node add-ons to provide the same kind
interface between nodejs and Linux native OS features.

What is missing currently is any unit testing of the C# code.  As (if) GPII uses C# more and more, unit testing will become necessary.  This README is a report on how unit testing might be accomplished.

Two approaches are discussed -- one where the C# functionality is treated as an interface accessed by a single JavaScript function, and that funciton alone is tested using the familiar `jqUnit` testing framework.

The second approach uses `edge.js`'s ability to call back into `node` from within C#.  Here the C# code runs the test scenario, and then passes the results back to `node` where the results are input to a standard `jqUnit.test()` function.

MORE TO COME.
